# Platform Engineering on AWS and Azure
**Overview**
This repository accompanies a hands-on session on Platform Engineering, demonstrating how modern development teams can build scalable, automated, and secure platforms using AWS (EKS) and Azure (AKS). The session blends theoretical understanding with practical implementation to showcase how Platform Engineering bridges the gap between DevOps and Cloud Computing.

**What is Platform Engineerin**g?

Platform Engineering is the practice of designing and maintaining internal developer platforms that automate application deployment, monitoring, and management. It provides developers with self-service infrastructure and standardized environments, enabling faster and more consistent delivery without deep infrastructure management.

**Role in DevOps and Cloud**

Platform Engineering enhances DevOps by providing the tools and systems that make automation, scalability, and reliability achievable at scale. When integrated with the cloud, it leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines to translate DevOps principles into practical, reusable systems.

**Key Benefits**

_Automation: _Streamlines provisioning and management of infrastructure.

_Standardization: _Ensures consistent environments across teams.

_Efficiency: _Reduces manual tasks and boosts developer productivity.

_Scalability:_ Supports cloud-native applications through Kubernetes orchestration.

_Governance:_ Enforces security, compliance, and access control.

**Core Components**

_Infrastructure as Code (IaC):_ Automates infrastructure setup using tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Bicep.

_Kubernetes & Containers: _Provides scalability, portability, and high availability.

_CI/CD Pipelines:_ Enables continuous integration and delivery for rapid deployments.

_Monitoring & Observability: _Tools like CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Prometheus maintain reliability.

_Security & Governance: _Implements IAM, RBAC, and policy enforcement for secure operations.

**Cloud Implementation**

This session demonstrates Platform Engineering in action using:

_AWS:_ Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), CloudFormation, CodePipeline, CloudWatch

_Azure: _Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure DevOps, Azure Monitor, Bicep

Participants will learn to deploy a production-grade Kubernetes platform, automate workflows, monitor applications, and ensure scalability across both clouds.

**Summary**

Platform Engineering empowers teams to innovate faster by combining automation, scalability, and governance. It brings DevOps principles to life — creating reliable, self-service platforms that streamline application delivery across cloud environments.
